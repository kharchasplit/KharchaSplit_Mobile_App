2. **Triage** (Maintainers)
   - Review new issues
   - Add labels
   - Assign priority
   - Assign to developer (if ready)

3. **Development**
   - Assign yourself to the issue
   - Change status to `in-progress`

   - Commit with reference: `git commit -m "feat: add feature (#123)"`

4. **Review**
   - Create Pull Request
   - Link to issue: "Closes #123"
   - Update issue status to `ready-for-review`
   - Wait for code review

5. **Completion**
   - Merge PR
   - Issue automatically closes
   - Verify in production

### For Developers Working on Features

```bash
# 1. Create/assign issue for your work
# 2. Create branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/issue-123-add-notifications

# 3. Develop and commit with issue reference
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement push notifications (#123)"

# 4. Push and create PR

## üìå Best Practices

### Creating Issues

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Search existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Use descriptive titles: "[FEATURE] Add dark mode toggle" instead of "Dark mode"
- Provide detailed descriptions with examples
- Add screenshots/videos when relevant
- Link related issues
- Update issues as work progresses

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Create vague issues without details
- Combine multiple unrelated requests in one issue
- Leave issues open after completion
- Ignore issue templates

### Working on Issues

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Assign yourself before starting work
- Update status labels as you progress
- Comment with progress updates
- Ask questions if requirements are unclear
- Close issues when work is complete
- Test thoroughly before marking as done

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Start work without assigning yourself
- Let issues go stale without updates
- Forget to link commits/PRs to issues
- Leave issues open after merging

### Managing Issues (Maintainers)

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Triage new issues within 24-48 hours
- Add appropriate labels and priorities
- Close duplicate/invalid issues with explanation
- Keep issue count manageable
- Use milestones for release planning

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Leave issues unlabeled
- Ignore community contributions
- Close issues without explanation
- Let critical bugs go unaddressed
